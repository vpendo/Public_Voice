Add PNG or JPG screenshots of the PublicVoice app here. The main README expects these filenames:

| File | Screen |
|------|--------|
| `homepage.png` | Homepage – landing, hero, services |
| `services.png` | Services page |
| `about.png` | About page |
| `contact.png` | Contact page |
| `register.png` | Register (citizen sign up) |
| `login.png` | Login page |
| `user-dashboard.png` | User dashboard (overview, Submit Issue, My Issues) |
| `admin-dashboard.png` | Admin dashboard (stats, reports, respond) |

After adding the files, the images will show in the main project README.
